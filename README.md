**ðŸ˜ŽInspirationðŸ˜Ž**
Individual, unique learning experience and One-on-one attention is why many people prefer tutoring instead of watching videos and answering practice questions.Websites such as Khan academy donâ€™t have tutoring help but they include practice tests/quizzes and videos for free.Other websites such as Applerouth have live sessions with tutors but you have to pay almost $100 per course.Thatâ€™s why I created StudyLog, a live tutoring website that helps you with your assignments/coursework for no extra cost for you.
**
ðŸ˜‰What it DoesðŸ˜‰**
It is a website that helps you with your coursework with informational videos, group studying, practice tests/quizzes and live tutors. It also includes study music by Spotify, a discord bot which sends questions based on a topic which you were struggling with to help our tutors. It includes a scientific calculator, which you can customize to the courses you are currently needing help with and you can send the question with an immediate answer back(includes a detailed feedback on solving it!)

**ðŸ˜›How we built itðŸ˜›**
We built it using Figma for design, Twilio for video calling, Google Cloud for sign in, Github for programming, Domain.com for the domain, StudyLog.Tech and GoDaddy for the mobile domain, StudyLogmobile.com
